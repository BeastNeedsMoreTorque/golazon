## Getting started

* Install
  * `yarn install`

* Run
  * `npm run start` - watches the project with continuous rebuild
  * `npm run build` - builds minified project for production
  * `npm run` - list of all build tasks

## Decisions

* Stack: Riot.js, CoffeeScript, SCSS, BEM.
* Build tools: brunch, npm.
* Architecture: static SPA site (hosted at GitHub) + external API.
* No images (except inline svg logo and 3rd party material icons)
